**The HHKB was my personal entry into the expensive keyboard world. Hearing about it first from some Twitch streamers, I could easily convince myself, thanks to the long list of positive reviews, that it's worth its money. As a programmer, it's a device that I'll earn my living with after all. In this post, I want to share my experience with you and also refer to another alternative that's worth considering instead - or perhaps additionally ;-) **

### My opinion on the HHKB Keyboard

Before diving into the specifics of the keyboard, here's my take on it!

**Pros:**

A definite advantage of the HHKB keyboard is the keys. The keys feel amazing! If you are chasing the "thock", then I also recommend some modding with anti-vibration mats. To me, the keys still felt a bit hollow without any modding.

Especially for coders (I guess most other people wouldn't consider spending this much on a keyboard) the command button is a game changer.

In general the adaption to that keyboard happens fairly quickly. To me, the most tricky thing to get used to were the arrow keys on the function layer. Although, this shouldn't be the only reason to get this keyboard, as you can easily remap the Caps Lock button on your macbook or keyboard. I was mostly suprised by how comfortable it feels - I would never have gotten the idea to apply that mapping myself.

Another important plus for the HHKB keyboard it its large community - it's cool to be a part of the community and share experiences with this great keyboard. Take for instance the reddit community, which you find here: https://www.reddit.com/r/HHKB/

**Cons: **

Gaming on the HHKB keyboard is only viable if wired. I also have a wireless mouse and sometimes my phone on the desk, and the connection was every so often interrupted. This is obviously not good when you're in the middle of an important fight!

Finding matching keycaps is not easy due to the topre adapter, creating a QWERTZ keyboard is not easily possible and if you find something its going to be pricy.

Due to the keyboards height, I would recommend a wrist pad for increased comfort and reduced strain.

As you can see there's not much to dislike about this keyboard! I would definetly recommend it, let alone for the keyfeel.

But - if you are willing to dive even deeper into the keyboard world, you should definitely check out the glove80. This is my successor of the HHKB, and while the switches don't feel as satisfying, it's for me the superior keyboard for programmers.

If you are curious about further details about the HHKB, you find a review of the Hardware, Features and Availability below.

### Hardware

The HHKB might be all plastic, but it doesn't feel cheap at all. The keycaps are crafted from PBT, which is known for its durability and resistance to the shiny wear that "normal" keycaps often suffer from. The board can easily be disassembled, but in order to do so, you will destroy the warranty sticker.

The real star of the show, however, are the Topre switches. [Read here](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Topre_switch) for a technical overview written by the deskthority wiki.
They have an activation force of around 45g, but that might be hard to compare with traditional spring switches due to their different technical nature. I own the Type-S, so the keys are even silenced for a quieter typing experience. While initially a bit underwhelmed, the more I used them, the more I started to like them. Adding my vibration mat mod really convinced me and continuously sparked joy while using the keyboard - I was quite literally, even after months of use, typing on the keyboard and thinking how nice the keys actually feel!

The layout is not quite a 60% one, but close enough. Check the [wooting guide](https://wooting.io/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-keyboard-layouts-and-form-factors) for a )  
for a detailed comparison. The most notable change is the command key on the pinky, placed where usually the capslock key is. What a genius idea! I adapted this change also on my laptop, as it really adds some comfort. The other more specific layout deviation are the arrow keys. Getting used to those took me some weeks, as you will need to use your pinky for the FN-Key layer to access them (if you don't change the default layout).

### Features

The HHKB can connect to several devices via Bluetooth and switch between them seamlessly. This is perfect for office use, but I noticed some delays when gaming. Also, there were occasional issues with my phone and wireless mouse on the table interfering with the HHKB's signal. The battery life was sufficient for my needs - in the honeymoon phase I did a lot of typing tests, and the batteries lasted easily more than one month. The lack of RGB is definitely helping the HHKB here!

The keyboard uses a USB-C connector and has Mac/Windows mode plus other switches on the backside for easy customization. I used it on both systems, set it up once, and then forgot about it. It's also a bit weird to lift the keyboard and fiddle with the small switches every time you move between operating systems. Similarly, there is a fully customizable layout editor, that I have set up once for slightly customized QWERTZ layout, and then never touched it again.

### Availability

I've gotten the impression that large parts of the keyboard enthusiast community on places such as Reddit are located in the US. As a newbie in this area, I found it quite difficult to actually find places to order some of these hyped keyboards from the community to Germany.

However, this one can be purchased in many places, even on Amazon(.de) where this specific model has more than 500 reviews already on its own. There are different models available; the Type-S is currently listed at 340â‚¬ - with a QWERTY layout. If you want to get the missing German keycaps, it's going to require quite some dedication and a deep pocket as well as you would most likely need a complete keycap set of something like a realforce keyboard. Due to the large popularity you have a good chance to get one used. I scored mine on eBay - it even came lubricated and, thank god, with German keycaps.
