summary: "My journey with the HHKB - from skepticism to daily driver, and why it might be worth the investment for programmers."
---

The HHKB was my personal entry into the expensive keyboard world. I first heard about it from some Twitch streamers, and thanks to the long list of positive reviews, I could easily convince myself that it's worth the money. As a programmer, it's a device that I'll earn my living with after all. In this post, I want to share my experience with you and also mention another alternative that's worth considering instead - or perhaps additionally ;-)

## First Things First - Is it Worth It?

Let me start with what you probably want to know right away - my honest opinion on whether this keyboard is worth its hefty price tag.

The keys feel absolutely amazing! If you're chasing that sweet "thock" sound, I definitely recommend some modding with anti-vibration mats. To be honest, the keys felt a bit hollow without any modding.

For us coders (I guess most other people wouldn't consider spending this much on a keyboard), the command button placement where Caps Lock usually is is a total game changer.

Getting used to the layout happens pretty quickly. The trickiest part for me was the arrow keys being on the function layer, but even that became natural after a few weeks. Another cool thing about the HHKB is its large community (see [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HHKB/))

## The Not-So-Great Parts

Gaming on the HHKB is only really viable when it's wired. I have a wireless mouse and sometimes my phone on the desk, and the connection would randomly drop. Not great when you're in the middle of an important fight!

Finding matching keycaps is tough due to the Topre switches, and creating a QWERTZ keyboard is not easily possible. If you do find something, it's going to be pricy.

Also, grab a wrist pad - the keyboard's height makes it pretty much essential for comfort.

## The Technical Stuff

Even though it's all plastic, the HHKB doesn't feel cheap at all. The keycaps are made from PBT, which is fancy keyboard-speak for "won't get shiny and worn out like normal keycaps." You can take it apart for modding, but that'll void the warranty.

The real star of the show are the Topre switches (check out [deskthority](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Topre_switch) for the technical details). I got the Type-S version with silenced keys, and while I was honestly underwhelmed at first, they really grew on me. After adding my vibration mat mod, I was completely sold - even months later, I still catch myself thinking "damn, these keys feel nice!" while typing.

The layout is almost but not quite a 60% keyboard (check the [wooting guide](https://wooting.io/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-keyboard-layouts-and-form-factors) for the nerdy details). The command key placement is genius, and while the arrow keys take some getting used to since they're on a function layer, it becomes second nature pretty quickly.

## Features and Daily Use

The HHKB connects to multiple devices via Bluetooth which is great for office use, though I noticed some gaming delays and interference with other wireless devices. Battery life is solid - lasting over a month even with heavy use. No RGB probably helps here!

It uses USB-C for wired connection and has switches on the back for Mac/Windows mode and other customizations. There's also a layout editor for full customization, but I only used it once to set up a slightly modified QWERTZ layout.

## Getting Your Hands on One

I quickly learned that a lot of the keyboard enthusiast community on Reddit seems to be in the US. As a newbie in Germany, it was pretty tricky to find places to order some of these hyped keyboards.

But the HHKB is actually pretty easy to get - you can find it on Amazon(.de) with over 500 reviews. The Type-S is currently going for about 340â‚¬ with a QWERTY layout. If you want German keycaps, be prepared for a quest and a deep pocket. Thanks to its popularity, you might get lucky finding a used one though. I found mine on eBay - it even came pre-lubricated and (thank god) with German keycaps!

## Final Thoughts

As you can probably tell, there's not much to dislike about this keyboard! I definitely recommend it, if only for how amazing the keys feel.

But here's the thing - if you're willing to go even deeper into the keyboard rabbit hole, check out the Glove80. That's what I use now after the HHKB, and while the switches don't feel quite as nice, it's become my favorite keyboard for programming.

Let me know if you have any questions about the HHKB - I'm always happy to geek out about keyboards!
